# 🚴‍♂️ Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

This project focuses on predicting bike rental demand using a variety of machine learning and deep learning models. By analyzing hourly and daily data from a bike sharing system, we explore patterns and build models to forecast bike usage, which can be used to optimize operations and resource allocation.

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset used is the [Bike Sharing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/bike-sharing-dataset), which contains information about bike rentals from a US-based city.

### Key Features:
- `season`, `mnth`, `hr`, `weekday`, `holiday`, `workingday`: Time-based and calendar attributes.
- `weathersit`, `temp`, `atemp`, `hum`, `windspeed`: Weather conditions.
- `casual`, `registered`, `cnt`: Count of casual, registered, and total users.
- `dateday`, `datetime`: Date and time info.

The dataset is split into two CSV files:
- `day.csv` — Aggregated daily data
- `hour.csv` — Aggregated hourly data (used for modeling)

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We performed EDA to identify trends and seasonality in the data:

- **Season vs Count** 📈
- **Yearly trends**
- **Hourly demand distribution**
- **Correlation heatmap** to find important relationships

📌 The demand is highest during business hours and in the summer/fall months.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

We trained and evaluated several regression models to predict the `cnt` (total number of rentals):

### Models Used:
- ✅ Random Forest Regressor
- ✅ Decision Tree Regressor
- ✅ K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor
- ✅ Ridge and Lasso Regressors
- ✅ Logistic Regression *(poor performance)*

#### 🔎 Evaluation Metrics:
- **R² Score**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

> ✅ **Random Forest and Decision Tree** performed best in traditional ML models.

## 🤖 Deep Learning Approach

We also built a **Neural Network (MLP)** using `TensorFlow` with the following architecture:

- Input Layer → Dense(128) → BatchNorm → Dropout
- Hidden Layer → Dense(64) → BatchNorm → Dropout
- Output Layer → Dense(1)

**Optimization**: RMSprop  
**Loss**: Mean Squared Error  
**Callback**: Early Stopping to avoid overfitting

📊 Evaluation:
- **R² Score**
- **MAE**
- **MSE**

We also tested **MLPRegressor from sklearn**, which gave competitive results.
